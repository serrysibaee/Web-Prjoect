# Web-Prjoect
this is a group project for the course SE371 

My main work in this project is to manage and lead the team to the deadlines while working on the backEnd and FrontEnd with my team

this project is about a CV host website to help employees to show their CVs in better way

thanks very much to my partners in this project:
1. Abdul Aziz Tawila (did a lot of the backend) 
2. Abdul Rahman Al-Kharsah 
3. Abdul Rahman Al-Boasi
